## Converting voxel datasets into meshes

{{< notes >}}
For scientific visualization, meshes are often extracted from volumetric datasets and then analyzed or rendered.
Annotations can be used to add specific information to volumetric datasets, such as marking points of interest (e.g., cell locations, regions of interest) or segmenting areas of the data. Converting these annotated datasets into meshes allows for the visual representation of those specific features.

When converting volumetric data to **meshes**, it's necessary to draw concrete borders between the **foreground** (the object of interest) and the **background**. This is achieved through:
{{< /notes >}}

- **Fixed thresholds**: Used to generate meshes by separating foreground from background using a set intensity threshold.
- **Content-based annotations**: Create precise meshes by using annotated regions to define boundaries.
- **Machine learning & interactive labeling**: Interactive tools combine user input with AI predictions to refine boundaries.

## Converting voxel datasets into meshes
### Marching Cubes
{{< notes >}}
The **Marching Cubes algorithm** is one of the most popular methods for extracting a 3D surface from volumetric data. It identifies the points in a voxel grid where the dataset crosses a specific threshold value (the **isosurface**) and uses those points to generate a mesh.

## Converting volumetric datasets into meshes
### Conversion scripts
{{< notes >}}
While several tools include converting volumetric datasets into meshes, VTK has worked particularly well in our 
experience. Check out the tutorial below for more details. This includes Python code snippets, but also the 
possibility to run conversion through a graphical user interface or command line using an Album solution.
{{< /notes >}}

1. Install and activate environment ([guide](https://github.com/ida-mdc/workshop-visualization/tree/main/visualization_software))
2. Download Notebook [voxel_rendering_napari.ipynb](https://github.com/ida-mdc/workshop-visualization/tree/main/notebooks/voxel_rendering_napari.ipynb) into workshop directory 
3. Type `jupyter lab` and press `Enter`
4. Open Notebook from list of files on the left side
5. Run Cells in the Notebooks one by one by pressing `Shift` and `Enter`

## Mesh processing
### Reducing mesh complexity
{{< notes >}}
Large, complex meshes can be computationally intensive to render. Reducing mesh complexity helps with performance, especially for web viewers or real-time visualization. We’ll explore some standard techniques to simplify meshes while maintaining critical details.
{{< /notes >}}

{{< horizontal >}}

- **Decimation**: A process to reduce the number of polygons in a mesh while maintaining the overall shape and detail.
- **Remeshing**: Tools like MeshLab and Blender offer remeshing techniques that can optimize mesh topology for better performance.
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Use LOD techniques to switch between different levels of mesh complexity based on the viewer’s distance.

## Rendering meshes
### Rendering meshes with Blender
{{< notes >}}
Blender is a powerful open-source tool for rendering meshes. It supports realistic rendering, including lighting, shadows, transparency, and advanced surface textures. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up Blender to render scientific datasets as meshes.
